This project was for my Introduction to Software Engineering course. Me and my team had to come up with a solution to a parking garage company (Denton and Denton) that faced issues with not having a fully automated ticketing system. They tracked each customer by their license plate instead of by ticket number. Also, there billing charges were off, some cars were charged and some weren't. 

We managed to create a fully automated ticketing system using python. The system is ticket number based instead of license plate based. Another feature of the system is we restrict tickets issued when the lot is full. A admin portal was also created for this project to implement a new report generation system.
